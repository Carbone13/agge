Anti-Grain Evolution [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tyoma/agge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tyoma/agge)
====

This project is based on ideas found in Maxim (mcseem) Shemanarev's Anti-Grain Geometry library, but oriented towards maximizing performance and stability. This engine sits on top of vector rasterizer and renderer rewritten from scratch in test-first style.
